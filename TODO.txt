* More thread safety? (BayesianUnit, MapManager)
* Re-use flocking (+learning of its parameters) in BayesianUnit
* Modify MapManager's damages maps to use DPS instead of raw damages
* Modify MapManager::updateStormPos() to use the interpolation of units 
  movements (with speed, done in BayesianUnit for the flocking for instance,
  just a matter of changing the datastruct)
* A finer resolution MapManager's damages maps / damages gradient?
* DEBUG ProductionManager/Arbitrator (see/breakpoints all producingUnits.erase(i))
* PROFILE and DEBUG ConstructionManager / BuildManager
* Add features, like reaver drop, drops, photons defenses, rushes, cheeses counters
* Remove HACK / TODO / TOCHANGE
* Clean and optimize only then
